I am a current Master's student at Geoegia Tech pursuing Computer Science with a specialization in Computing Systems. I did my B.E. from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in Computer Science. My research interests include network measurement and security, operating systems and cloud computing. 


Research Interests
======
I am currently a part of the [Internet Intelligence Lab](https://inetintel.notion.site/Internet-Intelligence-Research-Lab-d186184563d345bab51901129d812ed6) at Georgia Tech. My primary interests lie in network data analysis to filter out erroneous signals that might pollute Network Telescope data used by [IODA](https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/) for outage detection.

In the past, I worked on data from the UCSD Network Telescope as a part of my undergraduate project to identify and prevent DDoS attacks using machine learning techniques. 

I am also interested in scheduling problems in the distributed systems. To that end, I am taking the Advanced Operating Systems course at Georgia Tech this Fall to extend my work on efficient load balancing that I did during my undergraduate. (The publication can be found under the corresponding tab)

Personal Trivia
======
I am a Sebastian Vettel fan (and by consequence a Formula 1 fan). I am always up for "race watch meetups". If you are interested in a game of tennis, feel free to hit me up.

I am always available for discussions on problems in network analysis or even if you just want to drop a hi!
