excerpt: 'Smart grid are supposed to provide an efficient
means for energy trading using blockchain technology. They are
implemented to address the problems related to security and
privacy in transactions. Smart grids may aim to handle the
pricing of energy, the computation of the amount of energy used
or both in a secure and private manner. However there exist
several implementations of smart grids that are decentralized
using blockchain technology such as those using consortium
blockchains, multi signatures and ethereum smart contracts. The
concept of smart meters and charging pile sharing to improve
load distribution on the grid are also discussed. In this paper we
aim to identify the advantages and challenges that the various
implementations of blockchain in smart grids present to the users
and the energy market.'
